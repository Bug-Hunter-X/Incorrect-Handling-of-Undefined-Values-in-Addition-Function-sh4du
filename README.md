# Incorrect Handling of Undefined Values in Addition Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: incorrectly handling undefined values in a function designed to add two numbers. The initial implementation uses loose equality (==) to compare values to null and fails to handle the case where arguments are undefined. This leads to NaN results, making the function unreliable.

The solution provides a corrected version that explicitly checks for both null and undefined values, resulting in a more robust function.
